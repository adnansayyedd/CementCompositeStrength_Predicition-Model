# CementCompositeStrength_Predicition-Model

# Multivariate Analysis Project : 

# Problem Statement :
[Domain Knowledge]

# Objective :

1. To Predict Cement Composite Strength Based on Independent Columns


# Steps to Build Machine Learning Model 

## Step 1 :

 Import Basic Scikit Learn Libraries for Data Manipulation as well Data Visualization 

 ## step 2 :

 Data Uploading using Pandas Function 

 ## Step 3 :

 Doing Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA] --->

 1. Univariate Analysis

 2. Bi Variate Analysis

 ## Step 4 :

 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Also Feature Engineering**

 ## Step 5 :

 1. Split Data into Independent and Dependent Column i.e X and y

 2. using Train and Test split to prevent Data Lekage.

 # step 6 :

1. Model building using Scikit Learn Libraries

# step 7 :

1. save your best model as Pickle File

# step 8 :

1. Deploy pickle using streamlit
